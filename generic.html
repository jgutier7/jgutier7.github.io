									<p>Hi, I'm Jacob Gutierrez, a dedicated and highly motivated computer science student at the University of Notre Dame. With a strong passion for technology and innovation, I have consistently demonstrated an ability to work both independently and in group settings. I'm committed to producing quality work and am open-minded when it comes to learning new programming languages or technologies.

									</p><p>Hailing from Las Vegas, NV, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. Throughout my academic journey, I've maintained a 3.3 GPA while working a 20-hour work week as a lead. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in data structures, systems programming, embedded systems, logic design, and other relevant areas.
										
									</p><p>I have valuable professional experience as a student manager and team lead at Chick-fil-A and Duncan Student Center, where I demonstrated strong leadership, problem-solving, and time management skills. My ability to work efficiently under pressure has been recognized by my employers, leading to a promotion to Student Manager in January 2021.
						
										
									</p><p>In addition to my work experience, I have undertaken various computer science projects, both personal and class-related. One notable project is the full-stack development of a social drinking app called "bacND," aimed at promoting student safety. I have also worked on projects involving Unix File System, Heap Management, and Pub/Sub Chat System, demonstrating my versatility and adaptability in the field of computer science.
										
									</p><p>I am proficient in C/C++, Python, Shell Scripting, Linux/Unix, database management (SQL), React Native, GitHub, Microsoft Office, MATLAB, SolidWorks, and Photoshop, and am continuously learning new skills such as HTML, Swift/SwiftUI, JavaScript, and PHP. My interests include full-stack software development, machine learning, data visualization, and exploring new programming languages.
										
									</p><p>When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy photography and am always seeking opportunities to develop my skills further. I'm excited to apply my knowledge and experiences to real-world challenges and contribute to the growth of the tech industry.
